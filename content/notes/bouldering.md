# Bouldering

## What is Bouldering:

Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that focuses on shorter climbing routes which are close to the ground. The finish hold is usually between 4 to 5 metres off the ground.

Because of its close proximity to ground, this type of climbing is generally done without harnesses or anchoring equipment. To some people, the lack of supporting equipment makes it scarier in comparison to other types of climbing such as lead and top-roping.

But the mats are pretty good at catching you (_if you fall correctly_).

## Falling

That brings me to my next point: Falling is a part of it.

It's scary and takes a while to get used to it. I've been doing it for 2 years now and I'm still dead-scared of falling and IT'S OKAY. In my physio's wise words: "Your body is good at keeping you alive, that's why".

Here's a guide on how to fall safely:

However, if you watch people who climb really hard climbs, they rarely fall like that ðŸ˜’. It's because for harder climbs, you get yourself into much weirder positions which make it hard to fall like that. For example:

> So the better general rule is: if you can't safely fall from a position, don't get into it.

## Some climbing Lingo

- Beta: The route of which the climb is done
- Flash: Finish on first attempt
- Send: Successfully completing a climb from start to finish
- Project: Something you are working on
- Dyno: A dynamic move/climb
- Pump: When your forearms are overworked

## Grading

There isn't a standard grading method between gyms and it is location dependent ðŸ˜‰. Just ask a friendly local climber and they are happy to help.

## Why is it fun

Obviously it is very subjective why certain things are fun but if I have to pick one it's probably the non-repetive nature of the sport.

Most bouldering gyms will do a reset each week so you will get a fresh set of problems to solve weekly.

Don't get me wrong though, it can be very repetitive if you make it to be. Some people like to pick a project on work on it, and it could take them weeks to get it. However, if you are the type to be excited to challenge yourself with something new each week, it is very fun.

## Is it safe?

For indoor bouldering, it is quite safe as long as you follow the rules e.g. falling correctly.

It can be dangerous if you choose to put yourself in riskier positions.

## What not to do in your first session

There's hardly anything you can do wrong in this type of sport and everyone is pretty nice and understanding.

EXCEPT when you hog the wall and climb without looking.

If you aren't climbing, try staying out of the falling zone.

Before starting a climb, make sure no one else is going to cross path with you on the wall, usually an arm-span away is a good estimate. This is mainly because if you both fall at the same time, it is much harder to land safely.

## Conclusion

That's it for a quick introduction to Bouldering.

> It's okay to be bad and still have fun.

This is the advice I gave to myself when I started and still now. I'm not very good at climbing but I had fun everytime I went.
