Possums are small to medium-sized marsupials native to Australia and surrounding regions. Known for their soft fur, big eyes, and prehensile tails, they are agile climbers that thrive in both forests and urban areas. Most possums are nocturnal, spending their nights foraging for food such as fruits, leaves, flowers, and occasionally insects. Unlike their North American counterparts, opossums, Australian possums are generally more adapted to living in trees and have a strong association with eucalypt forests. Their ability to nest in roof spaces and adapt to city environments has made them a common sight in suburban backyards.

Beyond their cute appearance, possums play an important role in their ecosystems. By feeding on native plants and dispersing seeds through their droppings, they help maintain healthy forest growth. They also serve as prey for larger predators, contributing to the balance of the food chain. While they are protected native animals in Australia, their presence in urban settings can sometimes cause conflicts, especially when they nest in roofs or eat garden plants. Still, many people appreciate their ecological value and choose to live alongside them by installing possum boxes and creating wildlife-friendly spaces.
