In the world where the microservice architecture is heavily adopted in building applications, Kubernetes is a wonderful out-of-the box tool that assists the management of these containerised applications.

Kubernetes, known by some by a friendlier nickname k8s (Kates), is a container orchestrator. It makes sure that:

- Containerised applications run where and when you want them to
- The available resources are allocated effectively
- Minimise system downtime

## My K8s Dictionary (A growing list)

- **Cluster**: A group of computers (nodes) that work together to run the containerised applications
- **Nodes**: A machine that runs the workload. There are **master nodes** (control plane) and **worker nodes** (run containers)
- **Pod**:
- **Namespace**
- **Workloads**
- **Deployment**
- **Service**
- **ReplicaSet**
- **Kubelet**
- **Kube-proxy**
